# 🥛 Milk Rate Predictor using Machine Learning

This project is a real-world application of Machine Learning to help dairy farmers predict the **milk price per litre** based on **Fat** and **SNF (Solid-Not-Fat)** values. It was inspired by a daily challenge faced by my neighbours, who sell milk to a local Government Milk Society.

When their society's testing machine (especially the printer) fails, they are unable to know the rate until the final bill is issued every 10 days. To solve this, I developed a simple Linear Regression model that can instantly predict the rate based on Fat and SNF.

## 🚀 Features

- Predict milk rate instantly using Fat and SNF values
- Trained using real-world milk billing data
- Built with Python and scikit-learn
- Lightweight and easy to use
